# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the Library's function. This will 
# be shown from inside the PDE when the Library is being installed. Avoid 
# repeating the name of your Library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant 
# like mentioning that it's a Library. This should start with a capitalized 
# letter, and end with a period.
sentence = Library that eases the creation of interactive scenes.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your Library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph = Main features include: 1. Default interactivity through the mouse and keyboard that simply does what you expect; 2. Generic support for Human Interface Devices; 3. Arcball, walkthrough and third person camera modes; 4. Hierarchical coordinate systems (frames), with functions to convert between them; 5. Coordinate systems can easily be moved with the mouse. 6. Keyframes; 7. Object picking; 8. Keyboard shortcuts and camera profiles customization; 8. Animation framework; 9. Screen drawing; and, 10. Off-screen rendering mode support. 

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. 
# That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)

# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to 
# compare different versions of the same Library, and check if an update is 
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of 
# releases you've had.
version = 26  # This must be parsable as an int

# The version as the user will see it. If blank, the version attribute will be 
# used here. This should be a single word, with no spaces.
prettyVersion = 3.0.0-beta.4  # This is treated as a String

# The min and max revision of Processing compatible with your Library.
# Note that these fields use the revision and not the version of Processing, 
# parsable as an int. For example, the revision number for 2.2.1 is 227. 
# You can find the revision numbers in the change log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/processing/processing/master/build/shared/revisions.txt
# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your Library is known to 
# break in a later (or earlier) release. Otherwise, use the default value 0.
minRevision = 246
maxRevision = 0
