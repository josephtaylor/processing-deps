QScript changes incorporated into version


V2.2
No code changes just minor updates to examples to make it fully compatible with both Processing 2 and 3

V2.1
Vector data type added

Complex number data type added

Methods isNumeric(), isDouble(), isThing() etc have been removed use these variables instead
isNull isString isInteger isDouble isBoolean isVector isComplex isThing isNumeric
If you have created your own functions simple remove the '()' to use the attribute
rather than the function.

Syntax error messages have been made more descriptive over  2.1 
Improved recognition for unary +- signs.

Scripts can now have comments. The start of a comment is indicated by the
hash symbol '#' and continues to the end of the line. In other words they 
behave just like // in Java and Processing


V2.0
To make their purpose clearer the following classes have been renamed
    ParseErrorEvent class has been renamed to SyntaxErrorEvent
    ParseTokenEvent class has been renamed to TraceEvent
    BaseException class has been renamed to ScriptException

log(n,b) method added. Calculate the logarithm to the base b of the number n

Tokeniser now uses regular expressions making the code clearer and more 
maintainable. It means that although it detects all syntax errors the error
messages are less informative.

Variable names no longer have to start with $ (but will still accept them)
as a result of using regular expressions. 

Implementation of time limit changed so that WAIT time and trace delay time 
is ignored.

Default time limit reduced to 5 seconds because it only applies to evaluation
time.

In the Operator class the resolve method signature has changed. If you have 
created your own operators/methods then you will have to modify them.

The extras parameter in the ScriptEvent and child classes has been changed 
from Object to Object[] so more information can be passed to the event handlers.

The Thing class has been added so QScript can work with user defined classes
that can be scripted.
