# The name of your library as you want it formatted.
name = BRigid

# List of authors. Links can be provided using the syntax [author name](url).
authorList = [Daniel Koehler](http://www.lab-eds.org)

# A web page for your library, NOT a direct link to where to download it.

# The category of your library, must be one (or many) of the following:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"          
#   "Fabrication"   "Geometry"      "GUI"               "Hardware"      
#   "I/O"           "Language"      "Math"              "Simulation"    
#   "Sound"         "Utilities"     "Typography"        "Video & Vision"
# 
# If a value other than those listed is used, your library will listed as 
# "Other".
category = Simulation

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the library's function. This will 
# be shown from inside the PDE when the library is being installed. Avoid 
# repeating the name of your library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant 
# like mentioning that it's a library. This should start with a capitalized 
# letter, and end with a period.
sentence = bRigid provides classes for an easier handling of [jBullet] (http://jbullet.advel.cz/) in Processing

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph = bRigid is thought as a kind of Processing port for the bullet physics simulation library written in C++. This library allows the interaction of rigid bodies in 3D. Geometry/ Shapes are build with Processing PShape Class, for convinient display and export(dxf) jBullet is a Java port of Bullet (c) 2008 Martin Dvorak http://jbullet.advel.cz/; Bullet Continuous Collision Detection and Physics Library (c) 2003-2013 Erwin Coumans http://www.bulletphysics.com/ and many thanks to the jBullet/processing examples of Giulio Piacentino and Richard Brauer   

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. 
# That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)


# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to 
# compare different versions of the same library, and check if an update is 
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of 
# releases you've had.
version = 2  # This must be parsable as an int

# The version as the user will see it. If blank, the version attribute will be 
# used here.
prettyVersion = 1.1  # This is treated as a String
